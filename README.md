This is a small set of scripts which allow for downloading a set of packages. It's mainly desgined for personal use, but this does not mean it cannot be modified for wide-spread use.

## Getting Started

Just fire up an administrative command prompt and:

```batch
cd %HOMEPATH%
git clone https://github.com/markovejnovic/WinConf.git
cd WinConf
install.bat
```
